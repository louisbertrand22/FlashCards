## How Difficulty Affects Review Frequency

The difficulty level determines how often a flashcard appears for review:

- **Easy (1)**: Cards you find easy to remember - reviewed every 7 days
- **Medium (2)**: Cards of moderate difficulty - reviewed every 3 days
- **Hard (3)**: Cards you find difficult - reviewed daily

When you mark a card as reviewed during a study session, it's automatically rescheduled based on its difficulty level.

## Data Storage

Flashcards are stored in `flashcards.json` in the application directory. This file is automatically created and updated as you add, modify, or delete flashcards.
